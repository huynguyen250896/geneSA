Description: a log-rank test in univariate Cox regression analysis with a proportional 
    hazards model is performed to examine the association between the expression of each 
    gene and the survival rates of patients. Genes with Q-value <= 0.05 (Benjamini-Hocberg 
    procedure) are preserved.
